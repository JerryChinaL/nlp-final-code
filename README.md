 NLP Final Project Code

Our code files are organized and can be run in this order:

1. Data Processing 1 - Initial Read & Filter
2. Data Processing 2 - Merge News and Price
3. Embedding + Logistic + Bert

The data files are big (several GBs) so we didn't include it in this repo. They can be downloaded from the hugging face link we provided in the proposal, if you decide to run the code yourself.

It will also not be totally necessary because all the outputs should still be visible in the cells of our ipynb files.
