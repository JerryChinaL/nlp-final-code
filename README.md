 NLP Final Project Code

Our code files are organized and can be run in this order:

1. Data Processing 1 - Initial Read & Filter
2. Data Processing 2 - Merge News and Price
3. Logistic + LightGBM (Binary Classification)- CLS, sBert

extra: LSTM - finBert Tone is the file where we tested out the LSTM model from our reference paper, and calculated MAPE in comparison to ARIMA.

The data files are big (several GBs) so we didn't include it in this repo. They can be downloaded from the hugging face link we provided in the proposal, if you decide to run the code yourself.

It will also not be totally necessary because all the outputs should still be visible in the cells of our ipynb files.
